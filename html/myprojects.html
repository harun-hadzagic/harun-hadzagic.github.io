		<p class="introduction">Thank you for visiting the My Projects page. Here you can find some of the projects I worked on and completed as a part of my learning process. I plan to keep expanding on this page with every new project I complete as I am truly having a lot of fun coding all kinds of different things. <br> If you notice and bugs in my code please feel free to contact me and I will be sure to fix them!</p>
		<button class="accordion">Calculator </button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>This was my first project that I coded. The goal was to replicate the calculator that ce be found on iOS devices. As this was my first project the calculator does not have a decimals option or advanced operations like percentages or square roots. If you want to check out my calculator press <a href="calculator.html" target="_blank" title="Calculator" class="project">here</a>.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Whack a mole.. maybe it would be better to just feed it?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Whack a mole has been a very popular game for many years and is a great project for a junior web developer. Creating this was a challenging task but the secret was in breaking down the problem into many small problems and tackling them one by one rather than trying to solve the whole problem at one. You climb a mountain one step at a time, not by jumping from the bottom straight to the top. Inspired by love towards animals the game has a twist where instead of whacking the mole why dont we just feed it, after all it's a similar approach just a few minor changes? If you would like to try the game out click <a href="feed-a-mole.html" target="_blank" title="Feed-a-mole" class="project">here</a> and keep an eye our for the king mole as feeding him is worth double points!   </p>
