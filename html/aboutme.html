    <p class="about_me">Who am I? Buckle up, put your phone on, do not disturb and get ready to meet this amazing person called Harun aka me!

        I was born in Sarajevo in 1999, so one could say I am not from this millennium, right? Since then until today I have spent most of my days here in Sarajevo where I completed my education as well.
        
        Starting with my elementary school Izet Šabić, this is where I first encountered programming and had the idea that this is something I might want to do. Moving on to my high school Gymnasium Obala where I opted to focus on math and IT as my preferred subjects of choice even though this was considered the hardest option and I did struggle, looking back I only remember the good parts and don't regret it at all. Before I could graduate from high school I was offered a scholarship at the International Burch University in Sarajevo of the Faculty for Economics and Social Sciences, Department of Management where once again I was attracted to subjects like accounting and finance. Topics that required some level of math and problem solving in order to be good at them. During my studies here I would occasionally remember how much fun I used to have while coding and more often than not I would imagine myself sitting behind a computer and writing code just like in the movies. After graduating with a bachelor degree in Financial Management I decided to go one step further and acquire a MBA degree. During my MBA studies I finally decided to stop fantasizing and take some action when it comes to coding. I took a course on Java Script by Microsoft and completed the FrontendMasters bootcamp on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and this allowed me to gain the knowledge to construct this page that you are on right now!
        
            When it comes to my working experience, there is quite a bit more than people expect. Starting off while I was still in highschool about 16-17 years old I used to do volunteer work in a news agency calles Novo Vrijeme based in Sarajevo. I would also occasionally volunteer at a non-profit organization that focuses on providing scholarship opportunities to students all around Bosnia and Herzegovina that were not able to afford them by themselves. It wasn't until I was 18 that I first started making money. I started working in the tourism sector as a tour planner as well as a tour guide myself. As I now had my drivers license I could drive a group of tourists around Bosnia and make sure they would have the best experience possible. Soon after I had the opportunity to visit the United States of America where I could meet a lot of amazing people and meet their culture. I also had the opportunity to help a survivor of the war crimes in Bosnia tell his story as he couldn't speak English and I acted as the translator helping him speak with someone who was prepared to listen. Before my second visit to the USA my family decided to start a small hotel business. We rented a building in the old part of Sarajevo and opened our doors to guests via Booking, AirBnb and any other way they could reach us. The hotel was called Residence Mahala and business was good until the pandemic took over the world. As a newly started business we didn't have the cash saved up or the connection to keep up with the plummet of guest visitors. Our rent as a fixed expense stayed high and we could no longer stay in business and after two years of running we had to close our doors and leav Residence Mahala. During my time with Residence Mahala I managed to visit the USA once more. While in the USA I once again meet with Edo, an entrepreneur that I meet the first time I was there. His company conducted cargo transportation services in the USA and has grown substantially since the last time I was there. With a fleet of about 20 sprinter vans he was looking for a way to optimize his operations. With me in Sarajevo we were able to start a dispatch center as the expense of paying workers in Bosnia is much less than in the USA. Just like that a new chapter of my professional career started and I began working as a dispatcher coordinating activities in the USA from my home office here in Sarajevo. Soon after my start we decided that we need to bring more local people onboard. One by one new dispatchers would be interviewed and trained by me as our number grew up to 10 dispatchers. I was assigned a dispatch supervisor role and the operations manager for all the dispatchers in Sarajevo. For over two years I stayed in this company constantly using my knowledge as a manager to improve and optimize our operations and metiade relationships between coworkers, but unfortunately I couldt see myself doing this work for any longer so when I was confident enough that I have learned enough about coding to apply for a job I resigned from my position and at the moment I am unemployed and, for the first time in my life on the job market looking for a opportunity to grab. I am sure I will find it soon!
