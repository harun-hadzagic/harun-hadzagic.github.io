    <p class="text">    We all have our hobbies. The only matter in question is how many of us manage to put aside enough of our time to actually work on them? From my young days I always loved sports, any of them I was never one to pick a favorite. My parents enrolled me into basketball sessions and I spent a good 6 years of my life playing basketball and meeting new friends. I spent a lot of time playing other sports as well like soccer, volleyball, boxing and archery however basketball remained my favorite go to activities. As technology improved and became more and more affordable I started engaging myself with computers and smartphones. I was particularly interested in taking photos and videos and combining them using some video editing tools and just like that I found myself editing videos as a hobby. Here is a short promotional video I made as an attempt to promote my family business Residence Mahala.

I was able to save some money and purchase a DJI Mini 2 drone that is considered one of the best on the market. In order to show you some of my favorite photos and videos I used an open source swiper to present them to you, you can access them below:
